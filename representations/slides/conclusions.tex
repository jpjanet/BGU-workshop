\begin{enumerate}
	\item Different encoding schemes use different amounts of information \pause{}
	\item The representation needs to matched to the application in question \pause{}
	\item Representations should encode our notions of chemical similarity \pause{}
	\item Complicated, high dimensional featurization schemes require more data \pause{}
	\item atom-level featurization can be very effective for total energies 
\end{enumerate}
