The data set is constituted by 82 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH).
The following properties are given:

1) melting point (MP)
2) boling point (BP)
3) octanol-water partition coefficient (LogP)

Unknown values are identified by -999.

A set of 112 molecular descriptors (topological descriptors) is also given, both in Excel format (PAH_Descriptors.xls) and in a tab-delimited text format (PAH_Descriptors.txt).

The descriptors are calculated by DRAGON software (version 5.4). 
The whole list of descriptor labels and meanings is collected in the file Descriptor_Label_List.txt and Descriptor_Label_List.xls.
