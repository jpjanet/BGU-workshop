\begin{enumerate}
	\item Feature selection techniques can help identify important features, for modeling and for interpretation
	\item Iterative subset selection can be expensive since the model needs to be re-trained, including hyperparameters each time
	\item LASSO/elastic net provide simple ways of extracting most important linear features
\end{enumerate}
