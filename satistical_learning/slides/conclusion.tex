In summary:

\pause{}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We train models by changing their parameters to reduce errors on training data \pause{}
	\item More complicated models learn more slowly, but have more capacity\pause{}
	\item Regularization helps control complexity\pause{}
	\item Cross-validation (and related techniques)  must be used to choose hyperparameters\pause{}
\end{enumerate}

Deep neural networks (might) need better theories.
