\begin{enumerate}
	\item Models that are linear in their parameters can be formulated as kernel models\pause{}
	\item The choice of kernel uniquely defines the working of similarity in your application\pause{}
	\item Kernel models are quick to train, easy to understand and suitable for low-data applications\pause{}
	\item Cross-validation (and related techniques)  must be used to choose hyperparameters\pause{}
\end{enumerate}
