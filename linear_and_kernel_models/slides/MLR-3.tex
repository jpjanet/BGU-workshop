 It is worth briefly considering when the inverse $\left(X^TX + \lambda I\right)^{-1}$ exists. Assuming $n>d$, and no rows of $X$ are duplicates, in theory $X^TX$ can be inverted. \pause{} However, in practice rows of $X$ can be similar and some of eigenvalues of $X^TX$ can become very close to zero. Fortunately:
 
 \begin{align*}
 \sigma\left(X^TX + \lambda I\right)&=\sigma(X^TX)+\lambda\\
\uncover<3->{ X^TX +  I_{d}\lambda &= D^{-1}\Omega D +   D^{-1}D\lambda = D^{-1}\left(\Omega + I_{d}\lambda\right)D}
 \end{align*}
 
 i.e. Positive shift in all eigenvalues -- inversion is stabilized by $\lambda >0$, guaranteed stability for large enough $\lambda$.
