The matrix $K_{i,j}=\left\langle x_i,x_j \right\rangle$ is called the (linear) \textbf{kernel matrix}. \\
We can write the solution of the regression problem in this form -- it is \textbf{exactly equivalent}:
\begin{align*}
\hat{y}(X)&= Ka \\ 
a &=  (K+{I}_n\lambda)^{-1}y
\end{align*}
\visible<2->{The prediction at any new point is proportional to the inner product of each training point and the new point.}
